            <"Learn to walk, fall down. <br>
              Make mistakes, but learn from them. It may feel downhill but you can only go up from rock bottom, and rock bottom changes every time. <br>
              Failures are lessons learned; they don’t define you. But remember if you don’t get up, they will.">
